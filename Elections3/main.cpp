/*
Hello!
Welcome to our election program.
This program is divided to 3 main classes: Citizen, District and Party. each with its own Arr class to better manage the array.
the classes that end with Ptr (ie. CitizenPtr) are smart pointers that manage ownership of an object.
The Election class manages the interactions between the District array and Party array.
DistrictArr also functions as a citizen book, as it contains all citizens divided by districts.
